# virtonomics
Virtonomics framework in Python.

Virtonomics is a multiplayer browser business simulation game (see [the game website](https://virtonomica.ru/) for details).

The framework automates some basic game actions. It is based on the API provided by the game.

The core functionality is implemented in class Virta of virtonomics.py.

Class MyVirta (inherited from Virta), illustrates automation of more complicated actions. It is specific for the author's company and serves as an example only.
